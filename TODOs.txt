Current TODOs:
Read paper
	-> Understand procedure (reproduce results (?)); This is one of the first papers I see using volatility in inflation; what's the importance?; Also, reproducing results in that much detail would be too much; i can maybe look into a simpler problem
	-> Familiarity with US background and used datasets
	
Model proper lives instead of just using death probabilities -> Might have a question here; Do you still use S(t) in the expected value function?
Set death prob of last period to 1 -> might be clearer; also read what other comment he made on this point
Implement bequest function -> Read Cheng's mail for more details; Also think about limits of this function; Difference to luxury good feature?


Take a look at some other life cycle models in Julia (https://github.com/JordanVan/LifeCycleModelling)
Prepare HRS data (when I'm back in Zurich)



At some point we will add a minimum consumption (government subsidy)

Done:
Look into the EGM repository and see whether there is anything on bequests; (can you search online; do you have to download?)
    - I cloned (downloaded) the repository and searched for 'bequest' but didn't find anything (don't think that it's possible to do that online)
    - See (https://www.educative.io/answers/how-to-search-in-a-git-repository)
Implement nonlinear grid spacing
    - Copied Jeppe's code

Implement graph for optimal annuitization
